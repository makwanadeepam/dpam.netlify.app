# The purpose
The purpose of this blog is to post useful coding stuff in here.
I love blogging and started it a while ago but mostly posted about useless stuff.
Then again I started posting about psychology and critical thinking.
But, after a long long time, I've realized that I love coding. So this blog is mostly going to be about coding tutorials, tips, insights and maybe somethings about my journey!

❤️
